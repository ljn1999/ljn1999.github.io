  <br><b>Assistant Computer Vision Engineer in Noah’s Ark Lab, Huawei Canada</b><em>  Since May, 2020</em>
  <br><sub> - Reviewed papers of latest computer vision techniques and reported technology summary and findings. 
              Investigated open-sourced algorithms such as face detection and facial landmark localization, 
              and wrote test cases to evaluate capability and applicability of each algorithm.
  <br> - Processed the data and extracted features as inputs to machine learning models. 
         Benchmarked core algorithm on public dataset, and tuned parameters to improve overall performance.
  <br> - Designed the source code for python and android applications about driver drowsiness detection. 
         Refactored code to reduce cyclomatic complexity, conducted system tests to fix severe defects and accelerate the process.
  <br> - Communicated with the product manager and data collection group in HQ, 
         drafted the product's patent, and helped prepare work performance presentation.</sub>
    
  <br><b>Data Analyst Intern in Agriculture Bank of China</b><em>  July~August, 2019</em>
  <br><sub> - Participated in a data mining competition about loan overdue predictions and ranked top 10% among the participants.
  <br> - Developed models using Python (NumPy, Pandas) for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  <br> - Increased prediction KS value to 57% by optimizing algorithms and tuning parameters.</sub>
	
  <p><font size="5" color="blue"><b>Finished Group Projects:</b></font>
  <br><b>C++ Map project</b><em>  2019</em>
  <br><sub> - Developed C++ based algorithms for a map application; designed and completed frontend user interface.
  <br> - Implemented a navigation system using A* algorithm and Dijkstra to solve the shortest path issues.
  <br> - Integrated and combined greedy algorithm, simulated annealing, 2-opt, and 3-opt algorithms, genetic algorithms, etc., 
         to solve core features related to the salesman problem.</sub>
  <br><a href="https://github.com/ljn1999/Traffic-Sign-Detection"><font size= "5" color="indigo"><b>Traffic Sign Detection project</b></a><em>  <font size= "5" color="black">2020</em>
  <br><sub> - Enriched size of dataset by utilizing data augmentation based on Python to create training and validation sets.
  <br> - Implemented color and shape detection models to identify and localize traffic signs in the sample image data.
  <br> - Classified dataset into two stages and applied machine learning techniques including 7-layer CNNs to process data in each stage; 
         reached overall 60% accuracy of traffic sign recognition and localization in a driving record.</sub>
