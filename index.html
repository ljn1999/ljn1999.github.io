	<h1>Hi there, I'm Jiani Li!</h1>
	<p>Hi guys, I'm Jiani, nice to meet you virtually!
	<p>I'm an undergrad student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department @ University of Toronto. 
	    Currently I'm doing my PEY (Professional Experience Year, one year co-op) in Noah's Ark Lab, Huawei Technologies, Canada.</p>
	<p>Personally I have an interest in Mathmatics and Machines Learning, as an undergrad, I still have pretty much to learn about :-)</p>
 
	<p>The website is still under development... 
	<br>Learning HTML from scratch lol.</p>
